            <h5>At Free from UV at Cottesloe, we bring the community together to build shaded huts using recycled
                materials and help people stay protected from the harsh Australian sun. With 2 out of 3 Aussies being
                diagnosed with skin cancer in their lifetime, we understand how important it is to take steps to stay
                sun-safe.

                we value sun safety and aim at doing our best to reduce skin cancer rates in Australia one step at a
                time. by building sun safe huts it gives everyone the opportunity enjoy fun-filled day at the beach
                without worrying about the harmful effects of UV rays.</h5>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The issue at Cottesloe Beach is that there aren't enough shaded areas for visitors, causing people to
                    either sit directly in the sun or crowd under the limited shaded spots available. This not only
                    leads to discomfort and heat but also increases the risk of sunburn, skin damage, and long term
                    health issues like skin cancer. the solution I have chosen is hosting a two day event to build
                    shaded huts made from recycled materials. These huts will provide much needed shelter for visitors,
                    allowing them to enjoy the beach safely without the danger of over exposure to the sun.</p>

                <p>My explainer video highlights the key events, dates, and times that I want viewers to remember. I’ve
                    used vibrant, beachy colors throughout to create an energetic, positive vibe that mirrors the fun,
                    exciting day volunteers will experience when they register.

                    The goal of the video is to connect with my target audience, inspiring them to become part of the
                    community and make a difference. I also hope it directs people to the Free from UV website, where
                    they can register and learn more about the event and there impact and how they can help.</p>

                <p>The Free From UV app is an informative platform designed to educate users about the event. It
                    provides all the essential details, including what to expect, event dates, key activities, and
                    sponsors. The app also highlights the impact volunteers can make, showing them
                    how their involvement contributes to the success of the event. Additionally, users can easily
                    register for the event directly through the app. The app is simple and user freindly, it insures
                    that users are fully orginised and prepard for the event from start to
                    finish.</p>
