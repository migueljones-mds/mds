            <h5>Rolling Root is a community campaign designed for Milford Town, a vibrant area on Auckland’s North Shore known for its friendly, outgoing residents. Many locals here are middle-aged and enjoy spending their free time socializing and engaging in town activities—a perfect match for this project. The campaign centers on hosting a creative, hands-on event where residents and visitors collaborate to transform discarded trolleys into colorful flower beds. By blending art, gardening, and teamwork, Rolling Root aims to unite the community while beautifying public spaces, turning a shared problem into an opportunity for connection and pride.</h5>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Abandoned trolleys clutter Milford’s streets, creating eyesores, safety hazards, and environmental harm. Rolling Root directly addresses this issue by repurposing these trolleys into artistic flower beds during community events. This solution not only removes the trolleys but also repurposes them as symbols of renewal, fostering environmental awareness and civic responsibility. The campaign was created to leverage Milford’s active, socially engaged residents—particularly those with free time—to drive collective action. It’s important because it tackles a persistent urban issue in a way that strengthens community bonds, enhances public spaces, and inspires lasting change through creativity and collaboration.</p>
