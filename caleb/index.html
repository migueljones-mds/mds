                <p>The problem we are facing is the amount of litter being discarded on our playground grounds. To
                    battle this we have created an app. Contarq. Contarq has a reward system, allowing those to collect
                    and dispose other litter to collect points and earn rewards. We have also introduced a fining system
                    where our playgrounds automatically detect litter and fine those responsible. Fortunately we have
                    'Pay with Litter' which allows those with fines to collect other disposed waste and pay off that
                    fine. This is important as encourages those to help keep our parks clean and stops littering.</p>

                <!-- embed your hifi prototype here. Set the height to 700 in the iframe-->
                <p>Contarq is a park-cleaning app designed to eliminate littering through encouragement and
                    accountability

                <p>The Contarq app introduces your welcome with a quick update on the weather and a welcoming message to
                    keep the user motivated. They can see their stats and updates on their local playgrounds, they can
                    check other users' experiences by swiping left.</p>

                <p>The reward system is simple. On this page you can see your activity task and points, you can click
                    the triangle button to open the redeemable rewards, showing the amount needed to redeem those
                    prizes.</p>

                <p>The scanning page is a shortcut to scan the QR codes placed on our smart bins, first, you need to
                    press okay to allow the app to use the camera. After scanning it will automatically connect you to
                    your local park there you can start putting in your litter, earning you points with encouraging
                    words.</p>

                <p>If a user is caught littering, they will receive a fine. They can go to the support page and click on
                    fines. Then they will be greeted with their amount due and information about how and why litter is a
                    big problem.</p>

                <p>They can click on the triangle to bring up the incidents, with the time and date of when they
                    littered. They can pay for individual fines or pay all. Clicking on either will redirect you to the
                    payment options.</p>

                <p>The user can use google/Apple Pay, a debit card or they can opt to ‘Pay with Litter’. Clicking on Pay
                    with Litter will show how many litter pieces you need to pay off that fine. Clicking on the scanning
                    icon will redirect you to the scanning page, where you scan and connect. Then you dispose of that
                    waste. After completion, you are greeted with an encouraging message.</p>

                <!-- why should we support you-->
                <p>Contarq is not just about keeping parks clean; it’s about encouraging those to take action, being
                    rewarded for doing so, and holding individuals accountable but allowing themselves to take
                    responsibility. Protecting our shared spaces for future generations is guaranteed with Contarq, and
                    every effort matters. Littering threatens our environment, our communities, and our children, but
                    with Contarq, we have the demand to restore order and ensure that our parks remain safe and clean.
                </p>

                <p>Lets work together to keep our playgrounds a better environment. </p>
