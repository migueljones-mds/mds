                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Albany Village is dead. Businesses are shuttered and abandonded. Why? The area is old, dirty,
                    overgrown, and poorly lit. </p>
                <p> Albany Village Renewal proposes a solution that creates an exciting and welcoming space for Albany
                    locals to shop, eat, relax, and find community. This would start with a renovation of the area,
                    followed by a month long event campaign to create awareness of the space and build positive local
                    connections. </p>
