            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>This idea was inspired when looking around our Upper Riccarton area, it was observed that a lot of people were putting items that could be recycled straight into the trash. With a lack of recycling bins in public places and confusing recycling rules it seems easier to just throw recyclables into the waste bin. The Curbby app serves as a perfect solution as it condenses all recycling needs into one simplified place making the process quick and stress free as possible, helping people feel more motivated to recycle. </p>
